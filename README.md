# Boot.dev project attempt 2 (or 3)

## A very basic openGL with C (not C++) fps demo

This is just going to be a room that the player can move around in, and not much more than that.

Why not? Because it would probably take a lot longer than the 20-40 hours I'm supposed to spend on this project to make a full game, or even a complete level.

We'll see about the single level after I get a basic room to move around in.

## Requirements

Sorry Windows and Mac, Linux only (I know you're disappointed.)

Should run on most x86_64 / amd64 platforms

## Dependencies

Shouldn't be any since all libraries are statically linked.

## Installation

Clone repo.
From repo, run:
$ make
$ cd build
$ ./main
