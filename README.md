Hello this is a test so today is Sunday April 13th 3:43 p.m.   
 I'm trying to do a project for my boot.dev course it involves opengl  
 so far I've created a make file and I've set up the directory structure and I learned a couple things about how to link libraries with GCC.  

Okay 603 p.m. Sunday April 13th  
 and I've added a couple configuration files to my opengl project  
 the one called compile commands.json is for the sublime LSP plug-in so that it recognizes the include folder in my project  
 the other one is the project file itselfWhere I've added settings for the sublime linter for GCC plugin so that it sees the include folder in my project   
 I also got the make file fixed well not exactly I had to move the Glad source file to the main project directory or rather the main source directory so that I didn't have a complicated makefile  
Now I finally have a blank window for my opengl project it just shows a black window with a title and that's it. 

Sunday April 13th 10:48 p.m.  
 I've got a very basic program that shows a blue square in the middle of a window with a black background
